			<h2>Work</h2>
			<p>My distinctive illustrations have been used for everything from wine labels to mobile apps. Across this wide variety of platforms the art feels whimisical and handmade, as well as intentional and sophisticated.

		<section id="process">
			<h2>Process</h2>
			<p>The loosest sketches often germinate my best ideas. Research and sketching form the base for polished drawings, made with everything near my fingertips: ink, paint, toothbrushes, and a wacom tablet. The final art clearly reflects an illustratorâ€™s hand, but is digital in presentation and flexibility. </p>

		<section id="about">
			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>With a background in visual journalism at Newsweek and an MFA in Illustration I am very comfortable at the intersection of words and images.Co-founding BumpBump Books led me into the realm of designing for mobile devices, while a recent degree in UX reinforced my love of research and human centered design. </p>
