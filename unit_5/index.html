			<h2>Work</h2>
			<p>My distinctive illustrations have been used for everything from wine labels to children’s books, from portraits for Macy’s to maps for The New York Times. My career is centered around designing for real people, no matter the medium or platform. </p>

		<section id="process">

Research and sketching form the base for polished drawings, made with everything near my fingertips: ink, paint, (more) toothbrushes, and a wacom tablet. The final art clearly reflects an illustrator’s hand, but is digital in presentation and flexibility. </p>
